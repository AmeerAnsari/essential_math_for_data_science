This is the companion repo of the book *Essential Math for Data Science* with O'Reilly. You'll find here the datasets and the Jupyter notebooks with all the code from the book (COMING SOON).

# Datasets

The folder `data` contains the datasets you'll need in this book, except audio samples for the hands-on project on PCA in chapter 10 (the instructions are given to download the files).
